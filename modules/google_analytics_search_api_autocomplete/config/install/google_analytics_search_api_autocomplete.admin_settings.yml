# This allows users to configure which ui.autocomplete events they want to track,
# see http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/
# we intentionally skip "autocompletecreate" event
# because it's triggered when page with Search API Autocomplete widget is being rendered
# in other words, same event is being tracked by "pageview" hit,
# see https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/pages
