Description

This is a very simple module to make twig values available as an input filter.

Usage

Install the module as any other module. Visit the text format administration
page at /admin/config/content/formats/filters and edit a text format.
Check the 'Replaces Twig values' filter and save the text format.

When editing a form where this text format is used in a field, you can type
twig that will be replaced when the filed is rendered.
